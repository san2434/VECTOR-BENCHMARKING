================================================================================
KEY OBSERVATIONS
================================================================================
1. RETRIEVAL QUALITY:
   - 5 out of 8 questions (62.5%) had fully correct answers
   - 2 questions (25%) had partial answers due to retrieval gaps
   - 1 question (12.5%) missed entirely (reference count at end of paper)

2. CHUNKING IMPACT:
   - Fixed 500-char chunks may split important information
   - Questions requiring info from document end (q8) performed poorly
   - Questions with specific section keywords (q7) performed best

3. SEARCH PERFORMANCE:
   - HNSW provides consistent sub-10ms search times
   - Index build time (0.29s) is negligible for 164 chunks

4. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
   - Try semantic chunking (by paragraph/section) instead of fixed-size
   - Increase chunk overlap to reduce information loss at boundaries
   - Consider larger chunks (1000-1500 chars) for better context
   - Add metadata filtering for section-specific queries
